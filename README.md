## Getting started
Use one of the following methods to start blogging with `kirby-hemingway`:

1. [Clone](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/kirby-hemingway.git) or [download](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/kirby-hemingway/archive/master.zip) this repository.
2. Unzip / Upload the folder to your site's `root`.

### Configuration
Detailed instructions coming soon!

## Troubleshooting
The comment function is still **considered beta**, so beware of the following caveats:
- `markdown.extra` and KirbyComments' [Smartypants](https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) option being active at the same time throws a `Too few arguments to function Kirby\Component\Smartypants::parse()` error, caused by a [known bug](https://forum.getkirby.com/t/kirby-2-5-8-update-breaks-markdown-smartypants/9259) which will be fixed in the next release - until then, be sure to disable it via `c::set('comments.form.message.smartypants', false)`.
- For the [time being](https://github.com/Addpixel/KirbyComments/issues/34), KirbyComments doesn't work with the 'home' directory [being omitted](https://getkirby.com/docs/developer-guide/advanced/routing#omitting-the-blog-folder-in-urls), therefore activating the comment function disables custom routing of the 'home' directory (so you'll get `http://example.com/home/example-post` instead of `http://example.com/example-post`).
